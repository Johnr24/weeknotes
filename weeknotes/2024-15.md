# Weeknotes 15

A week has passed. The normal things have orbited.

## Is surveillance good?

...is a question I've been asking. I've asked many people and read some books.

## I got naked

It was [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io/) on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, thanks to timezones. I got naked for it. Lots of others did too.

## I went to a craft night

At the hackspace, there is now crafting on Wednesdays. It may not be every Wednesday. I am going to try and roster the popularity of it.

## I did some things on GitHub

I was going to look at my profile to see what I did. I am not going to. Do feel free to.

## I went to London

I intentionally don't live in London. There are many reasons.

This visit, some reasons I was reminded of were that:

- I was advertised to more than I remembered humanly possible
- There were more people sitting in a grassy square than I remembered humanly possible
- Alcohol and chocolate was more expensive than I remembered humanly possible

## I came back from London

I hitchhiked back. More people should give it a go. Three people gave me a lift. Thanks guys.

## I did some more anvil emoji

Running out of time. You'll have to wait til next week for more info here.

Go untoward doing-things-wot-you-find-fun.

Another time.
