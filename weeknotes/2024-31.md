# Weeknotes 31

Good evening! I don't feel like sharing much this week, but that's ok!

Perhaps you could assess a long-term trend in my mood by reading through many weeks of these.

Please don't

I write from a conundrum: my phone, but using a keyboard. I bought a bluetooth one from the electronics shop
and I have hopes and dreams.
I have Frankenstein'd together a computer on my phone by using Termux, Andronix, and Ubuntu, meaning that I
can use a terminal super easily, and I can also (if I so wish) use a Desktop environment via VNC.
I'm not sure how handy this will be, but it could be nice. If my phone is powerful and has the space for it,
why shouldn't it contain a tiny computer.

In lieu of letting you too far into my brain, I provide a text-based list of what I've been up to this week.

To provide you at least minimal amusement, and maximal insight into my self,
the list is formatted exactly as I made it on my phone earlier.

What have I been up to this week?
