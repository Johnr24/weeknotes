# Weeknotes 36

Good evening. Here is a weeknote.

The format this week is: sentences.

What did I do this week?

- I installed <https://streetpass.social/>, a Firefox extension which collects Mastodon accounts for websites you visit. I haven't got any yet. I should do some more web browsing.
- I started a small project, which is a public social calendar. It's honestly inspired by <https://astro.dur.ac.uk/~dma/davo_location.html>. It will be released soon.
- I submitted an issue to SheetJS: <https://git.sheetjs.com/sheetjs/sheetjs/issues/3192>. There was a difference between the date parser in Firefox and Chrome, which both parsed `9-2` differently.
- I released lipu tenpo nanpa lawa: <https://liputenpo.org/lipu/nanpa-lawa/>. The homepage also looks good: <https://liputenpo.org/>.
- I wrote a month update for Sheffield Hackspace: <https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/month-updates-august-2024/>
- I tried to automatically create a print-version of a PDF. It was sort of annoying, and I didn't manage it. Some of my thoughts are here: <https://github.com/lipu-tenpo/selo/issues/1>
- I modified my profile picture for Rambling Readers, an instance of BookWyrm I'm part of: <https://ramblingreaders.org/user/alifeee/>
- I set up a test instance of BookStack: <https://www.bookstackapp.com/>, to try it out. I like it so far. I might use it as a house wiki.
- I had a look around test versions of <https://nextcloud.com/> and <https://cryptpad.fr/>, to see if they could be good replacements of Google Drive. I think they could be. I had fun.

- I got a letter about a street party happening in my street.
- I went to collage club.
- I went to a cold dip.
- I went to a museum and saw some stuffed animals.
- I had a cardboard sword fight
- I played badminton
- I confirmed my attendance to a coop hackathon
- I missed a meeting on bus franchising

- I upholstered a small foam cushion
- I bought some new scissors
- I met a big spider
- I started reading The Dark Forest
- I bought a duvet (it's getting cold enough now)

- I bought a 256 GB M.2 drive for my PC. I plan to (dual) boot Linux on it, and be able to use Linux on my computer. I will probably install Mint.
- I set up the thermal printer at home to print QR codes. I will print a QR code for the WiFi network.
- I set up IPTV on my raspberry pi.

That is all. It is on you to categorise the four bullet lists above.

Listen to Jimi Hendrix.
