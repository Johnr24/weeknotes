# Weeknotes 41

good evening. SHHHHH. I'm in a library. You should know.

this week we have a new categorisation, and a (revived) hatred of capital letters. you shan't find any past this point (non-monetary reward if you do) (apart from capital i, I can't forsake that that easily)

what did I do this week, organised crudely by "type of attempt" ?

## tried and failed

- I tried to convince someone that they could use obsidian as a replacement for emacs. I don't think they heard me as they were too busy configuring emacs.
- I tried to take a screenshot of my tesco clubcard. I couldn't. I should be able to. the phone should be of my manufacture.

---

hmm, I've lost my motivation. don't force yourself. however, I'll provide you the rest of my rough notes.
(the capital letter bounty is exempt from this point on)
