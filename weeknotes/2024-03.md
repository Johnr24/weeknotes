# Weeknotes 03

This week I come to you from in front of a boiling pan of potatoes.

It's very windy outside.

## I did some more work on the lipu tenpo website

I did some more work on <https://github.com/lipu-tenpo/liputenpo.org>! It's now approaching enough that <https://liputenpo.alifeee.co.uk/> (hopefully a dead link) can soon be put on <https://liputenpo.org/>.

## I learnt sewing theory

Last week I borrowed a book on sewing basics.

Yesterday I read it. Now I've been exposed to many different types of stitch, zip, button, and fastening.

Eventually I'll start making my dress.

## I played Factorio again!

I played session 2 of the massive proximity chat Factorio game! It went great :)

## I went to a co-working space

It was alright.

## I saw stuff by Phlegm

They're an artist based in Sheffield. They have a gallery in town at the moment. I recognised their work much more than I thought I might.

## I made a Spanish Omelette

It was tasty.

Now, I must get back to these potatoes.
