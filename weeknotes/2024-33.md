# Weeknotes 33

Woah, I nearly fell asleep ! That wouldn't be too great.

I'm tired as I've spent all weekend making a video game with friends!

We made <https://jman9092.itch.io/summon-to-scale> in 48 hours between 6 of us.

On Friday I took notes of what else I'd done this week. I shall not expand on these points.

```text
move house
  gathered lots of boxes
  moved computer to studio
  signed tenancy agreement
  pack up stuff 
  not pack down stuff
  visit landlord
helped someone laser cut a guitar (they did all the work)
couldn't launch dndg on my laptop
twins?
comedy night
craft night (quarter of rag rug)
planned a Minecraft server
```

That's all. Next week may hold more excitement. It may not. Stay on your toes, but don't ruin the balls of your feet.

Until next time.
