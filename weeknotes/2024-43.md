# Weeknotes 43

Good evening. We have a short one for you this week. But, to keep you one your toes, I have shuffled the letters around in the most context-heavy word of each bullet point.

I did this in WSL with 

```bash
printf "antidisestablishmentarianism" | sed 's/\(.\)/\1\n/g' | shuf | awk '{printf "%s", $0} END {print ""}'
```

There was probably an easier way to do it (`shuf` only shuffles lines, not characters, I think, so I split the word into lines and then un-split it). Anyway...

What did I do this week, in no particular order?
