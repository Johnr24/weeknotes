# Weeknotes 42

Good evening. It is late. It is dark. But, the moon looks nice.

What did I do this week?

Well, that question isn't an introduction into a regurgitation of text this week. Instead, it's a link to a meta discussion. Pertinently, that means that I will now give you a list of things I've made this week, and what follows will be a very unorganised list of things that I've been doing.

## Things I've made you can see

- I added a page about Sheffield to my website -> <https://alifeee.co.uk/sheffield/>
- I added a page about maps to my website -> <https://alifeee.co.uk/maps/> (maps that I've made, mainly `geojson` files)
- I made a map of UK service stations using data from <https://motorwayservices.uk/> -> <https://github.com/alifeee/service-stations>
- I fixed an RSS feed being invalid due to bad characters (namely, "Ã©") -> <https://github.com/alifeee/simple-calendar/commit/358c47c5c454836053d3b96bdc381113c80d7eb0>
- I used bash and gnuplot to make a bar chart -> <https://gist.github.com/alifeee/2e1ea8ad5290a553316e715f658f1fd7#bar-charts>
- a lipu tenpo release was made without me ! -> <https://github.com/lipu-tenpo/liputenpo.org/pull/120>

## Things I've made you can't see

- I helped make some tasty dumplings (and didn't help make a tasty cake)
- I used a vinyl cutter to make a sign
- I made a note of the screw heads a fridge uses, in order to switch the door round when I can access the very specific tool
- I made some cards to celebrate my 1 year in Sheffield
- I cooked some tasty meals
- I downloaded group chat information from Instagram and made some bar charts
- I emailed someone about a broken link on their website
- I made and used some generated Tesco clubcards
- I put some new brakes on my bike at [Sheffield Community Bike Project](https://sheffieldcommunitybikeproject.org/)
- I made some emails directed towards my landlord
- I made some FrankenTrousers at craft night
- I created some issues in a trickling sense for the hackspace month notes

## The rest

- I ate at wellbeing cafe
- I was shown up by gnocchi being guessed in 18 questions
- A new contributor appeared for the lipu tenpo website
- a mars bar was not dispensed
- I got a phone call from "Jaws". I didn't answer
- I joined a maths Discord
- I ate white chocolate digestives
- I set up dotfiles sync using Atuin, so my aliases now sync across machines (well, I have to set it up on each other machine first, but the principle is there)
- I didn't play Gloomhaven again. One week out of three isn't a bad rate.
- I keep wanting to set up a Discourse forum. Maybe I will
- a calendar I made it being used. It is very cute.
- I watched an episode of Only Connect because my friend was on it. I also watched University Challenge afterwards, a rare watch for me. Then, I got even more distracted and watched a show about space by Brian Cox
- I watched a couple of games of Kabaddi, as it's the start of PKL season 11

## The End

In some ways, we end before we really begin.

Look up at the moon regularly and without pretense.

until next week
