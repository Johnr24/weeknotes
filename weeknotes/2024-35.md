# Weeknotes 35

At this point, these are only consumable by my own brain, and at that, probably only my own brain up to six months in the future until I forget everything.

Anyway, I have a headache, so it's short again this week.

Perhaps it's almost like a riddle, trying to figure out what the hell any of this means.

What did I do this week? In no particular order:

```text
went to a graveyard
assembled some items on a bookshelf
seen sone people find stink pipes
bought some power strips
drew a new picture for my rambling readers
browsed EMF talks on media.ccc
picked blackberries from back garden
went to coop hackathon meeting
posted a couple of instagram posts
watched only connect
stink poles of melbourne liked my post on Instagram
laser cut a spock
revived an old tablet
made hackspace month notes
prepared lipu tenpo nanpa lawa release
set up raspberry pi
playing with ip tv
adjusted lipu tenpo print+post prices
made issue in opentechcalendar about big news
responded to lipu tenpo website header PR
made an automatic deployment for lipu tenpo pull requests
saw a waterfall
watched star trek
created a script to make a text-based TV guide
updated bar chart gist
```

Until next time.

Don't reheat rice more than a day after you cooked it.
